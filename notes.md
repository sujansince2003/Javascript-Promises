<h1>when creating Promises in javasript using new keyword there are two parameters passed resolve and reject . what are these? </h1>

When you create a **Promise** in JavaScript using the `new Promise` constructor, you pass a **callback function** as an argument. This callback function takes two parameters: **`resolve`** and **`reject`**. These are functions provided by the JavaScript engine that allow you to control the state of the Promise.

### **`resolve`**

- **Purpose**: The `resolve` function is used to mark the Promise as **fulfilled (successful)** and pass the resulting value to the `.then()` handlers.
- **What it does**:
  - Changes the Promise state from **"pending"** to **"fulfilled"**.
  - Passes the resolved value to the next `.then()` in the Promise chain.
- **When to use**: Call `resolve` when the asynchronous operation completes successfully.

#### Example:

```
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const data = "Success!";
  resolve(data); // Fulfill the promise with the value "Success!"
});

myPromise.then((result) => {
  console.log(result); // Logs: "Success!"
});

```

### **`reject`**

- **Purpose**: The `reject` function is used to mark the Promise as **rejected (failed)** and pass the error reason to the `.catch()` handlers.
- **What it does**:
  - Changes the Promise state from **"pending"** to **"rejected"**.
  - Passes the error to the `.catch()` handler.
- **When to use**: Call `reject` when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails.

#### Example:

```
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const error = "Something went wrong!";
  reject(error); // Reject the promise with an error message
});

myPromise.catch((error) => {
  console.log(error); // Logs: "Something went wrong!"
});

```

### **How `resolve` and `reject` Work Together**

- A Promise can only transition from **"pending"** to either:
  1.  **"fulfilled"** when `resolve` is called.
  2.  **"rejected"** when `reject` is called.
- Once a Promise has transitioned to a settled state (fulfilled or rejected), it cannot change state again.

#### Example: Simulating an Asynchronous Task

```
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  const isSuccess = true; // Simulate success or failure
  if (isSuccess) {
    resolve("Task completed successfully!");
  } else {
    reject("Task failed!");
  }
});

myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result); // Logs: "Task completed successfully!" if resolved
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Logs: "Task failed!" if rejected
  });

```

### **Key Points about `resolve` and `reject`**

1.  **Only one can be called**:

    - Once you call `resolve` or `reject`, the Promise is settled and its state cannot change.
    - Example:

      ```
      const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve("Done!");
        reject("This won't be executed."); // Ignored
      });

      ```

2.  **Optional Values**:

    - Both `resolve` and `reject` can take a value or reason, but they are optional.
    - Example:

      ```
      const myPromise = new Promise((resolve) => {
        resolve(); // Resolves with `undefined`
      });

      myPromise.then((result) => {
        console.log(result); // Logs: undefined
      });

      ```

3.  **Chaining with `.then()` and `.catch()`**:

    - Values passed to `resolve` or `reject` are accessible in `.then()` and `.catch()` handlers, respectively.
    - Example:

      ```
      const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        resolve("Hello, world!");
      });

      myPromise
        .then((result) => {
          console.log(result); // Logs: "Hello, world!"
          throw new Error("Something went wrong!"); // Triggers the catch block
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.error(error.message); // Logs: "Something went wrong!"
        });

      ```

### **Common Use Case Example: Simulating an API Request**

```
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const success = true; // Simulate success or failure
      if (success) {
        resolve({ data: "Fetched data successfully!" });
      } else {
        reject("Failed to fetch data!");
      }
    }, 2000); // Simulate a 2-second delay
  });
}

fetchData()
  .then((result) => {
    console.log(result.data); // Logs: "Fetched data successfully!" if resolved
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error); // Logs: "Failed to fetch data!" if rejected
  });

```

### **Summary of `resolve` and `reject`**

| Aspect           | `resolve`                        | `reject`                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**      | Fulfill the Promise with a value | Reject the Promise with a reason |
| **State Change** | "pending" â†’ "fulfilled"          | "pending" â†’ "rejected"           |
| **Next Step**    | Triggers `.then()` handlers      | Triggers `.catch()` handlers     |
| **Use Case**     | Successful completion            | Failure or error                 |
